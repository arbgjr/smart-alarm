docs(architecture): document sophisticated multi-language service design

- Comprehensive architecture overview explaining Go/Python/Node.js specialization
- Architecture Decision Record documenting backend design rationale and trade-offs
- Security architecture emphasizing privacy-by-design principles throughout
- Performance and scalability considerations for neurodivergent user growth

The multi-language architecture optimizes each service for specific needs:
Go provides high-performance alarm operations, Python enables privacy-preserving
AI analysis, and Node.js orchestrates external integrations.
