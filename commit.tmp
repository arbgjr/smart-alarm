docs: create comprehensive documentation structure

- Establish complete directory hierarchy for all documentation types
- Add navigation indices for accessibility and discoverability
- Create GitHub issue templates for bug reports and accessibility improvements
- Set up specialized sections for architecture, development, accessibility, security

This structure follows the same progressive disclosure principles used in the
Smart Alarm interface, providing clear entry points for different contributor
communities while maintaining focus on neurodivergent user needs.
