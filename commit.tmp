Add development environment setup and integration testing documentation

- Created `dev-environment-docs.md` to outline the setup and management of the Smart Alarm development environment using Docker.
- Added scripts for starting, stopping, and testing the development environment (`start-dev-env.sh`, `stop-dev-env.sh`, `test-integration.sh`).
- Implemented health checks for services in the development environment.
- Documented integration testing standards and organization in `integration-testing.md`.
- Included examples of integration tests for RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, MinIO, HashiCorp Vault, and observability services.
- Enhanced user experience with colored output messages in scripts for better readability.
