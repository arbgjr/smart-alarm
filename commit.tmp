docs(development): add comprehensive guides for accessibility-first development

- Frontend guide emphasizing accessible React component development patterns
- Backend guide covering multi-service coordination and security implementation
- PWA implementation guide ensuring reliable offline functionality across platforms
- Testing strategies including accessibility validation with real users

These guides help contributors understand how technical implementation choices
directly impact neurodivergent user experience, treating accessibility as a
design philosophy rather than a compliance checklist.
