# Memory Bank System

The Memory Bank maintains context between sessions in hierarchically organized Markdown files.

## Hierarchy and Flow

```
projectbrief.md â†’ fundamental base
    â†“
productContext.md  systemPatterns.md  techContext.md
    â†“                   â†“                 â†“
           activeContext.md â†’ current work
                  â†“
             progress.md â†’ status
```

- Information flows from top to bottom
- Upper-level files inform the lower ones
- Conflicts are resolved by prioritizing higher-level files

## Main Files

1. **projectbrief.md**

   - Fundamental requirements and objectives
   - Source of truth for the scope

2. **productContext.md**

   - Project purpose
   - Problems to solve
   - Desired user experience

3. **systemPatterns.md**

   - Architecture
   - Technical decisions
   - Design patterns
   - Component relationships

4. **techContext.md**

   - Technologies used
   - Configurations
   - Dependencies

5. **activeContext.md**

   - Current focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions

6. **progress.md**
   - Completed features
   - Pending items
   - Current status
   - Known issues

## Workflow

1. **Start**: Consult the Memory Bank for context
2. **Plan**: Plan Mode (// mode: plan)
   - High-level strategies
   - Task breakdown
   - Prioritization
3. **Execute**: Act Mode (// mode: act)
   - Concrete implementation
   - Code generation
   - Testing
4. **Update**: Document changes in the Memory Bank

## Updates

Update when:

- New patterns are discovered
- Significant changes are implemented
- The **update memory bank** command is received
- Context clarification is needed

**Important**: In case of **update memory bank**, review ALL files, focusing on activeContext.md and progress.md.
