# Pull Request Instructions

## 1. PR Purpose & Context

### Clear Objective Statement
Every PR must start with a clear, business-focused purpose that explains the value delivered:

```markdown
## üéØ Purpose

This PR implements JWT token revocation to enhance security by preventing the use of
compromised or logged-out user tokens. Users can now log out securely, and administrators
can revoke access for specific tokens when necessary.
```

### Business Value Context
- **User Impact**: How does this change affect the end user experience?
- **Technical Improvement**: What technical debt is resolved or system capability added?
- **Security Enhancement**: What security vulnerabilities are addressed?
- **Performance Gains**: What performance improvements are achieved?

## 2. Technical Implementation Details

### Architectural Changes
Document how the change fits within Clean Architecture:

```markdown
## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture Layer Changes
- **Domain**: Added `JwtToken` value object with revocation capabilities
- **Application**: Implemented `RevokeTokenCommandHandler` for token lifecycle management
- **Infrastructure**: Added Redis-based `IJwtBlocklistService` for distributed token storage
- **API**: Updated authentication middleware to check token blacklist

### Design Patterns Applied
- **Repository Pattern**: `IJwtBlocklistService` abstracts token storage implementation
- **Command Pattern**: Token revocation handled via MediatR command
- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple blacklist providers (Redis, In-Memory) based on environment
```

### Code Quality Measures
- **Clean Architecture Compliance**: Verify layer boundaries are respected
- **SOLID Principles**: Demonstrate adherence to design principles
- **Error Handling**: Document exception handling and failure modes
- **Observability**: Include logging, tracing, and metrics implementation

## 3. Testing & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
```markdown
## ‚úÖ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (95% Coverage)
- **Domain Logic**: JWT token validation and revocation rules
- **Command Handlers**: Token revocation workflow and error scenarios  
- **Services**: Blacklist service implementations with different providers

### Integration Tests
- **Database Integration**: Token persistence and retrieval from Redis
- **API Endpoints**: Authentication middleware with blacklist validation
- **Message Flow**: Event publishing when tokens are revoked

### Manual Testing Scenarios
- **Happy Path**: User logout revokes token successfully
- **Edge Cases**: Concurrent token revocation, expired token handling
- **Security**: Attempt to use revoked tokens fails appropriately
```

### Performance & Security Validation
- **Performance Impact**: Measure authentication latency with blacklist checking
- **Security Testing**: Verify revoked tokens cannot access protected resources
- **Load Testing**: Confirm system handles high token revocation volume
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor Redis memory consumption for token storage

## 4. Database & Migration Changes

### Schema Changes
```markdown
## üóÑÔ∏è Database Impact

### New Tables/Indexes
- No schema changes - using Redis for token blacklist storage

### Data Migration
- No data migration required
- Existing tokens continue to work until expiration

### Rollback Strategy
- Disable blacklist checking in configuration to rollback
- Clear Redis blacklist keys if needed: `redis-cli FLUSHDB`
```

### Migration Testing
- Test migrations in development environment first
- Verify rollback procedures work correctly  
- Document any manual steps required for deployment
- Validate performance impact of schema changes

## 5. Configuration & Deployment

### Environment Configuration
```markdown
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Changes

### New Environment Variables
```bash
# Redis connection for JWT blacklist
REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING=localhost:6379
JWT_BLACKLIST_ENABLED=true
JWT_BLACKLIST_TTL=86400  # 24 hours in seconds
```

### Feature Flags
- `JWT_BLACKLIST_ENABLED`: Allows gradual rollout and quick rollback
- Environment-specific defaults: enabled in prod, optional in dev
```

### Deployment Considerations
- **Zero-Downtime**: Explain how changes deploy without service interruption
- **Configuration Updates**: List required configuration changes per environment
- **Service Dependencies**: Document any new external service dependencies
- **Rollback Plan**: Clear steps to rollback if issues arise

## 6. External Integrations & Dependencies  

### Third-Party Services
```markdown
## üîó External Dependencies

### New Service Dependencies
- **Redis**: Required for distributed token blacklist storage
- **Health Check**: Added Redis connectivity health check endpoint

### API Changes
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts
- New optional `X-Token-Revoked-At` header in error responses
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Ensure existing API clients continue to work
- Document any deprecated endpoints or parameters
- Provide migration guide for breaking changes
- Maintain support for previous versions where possible

## 7. Security & Privacy Impact

### Security Enhancements
```markdown
## üîí Security Impact

### Vulnerabilities Addressed
- **Token Reuse**: Prevents compromised tokens from being reused
- **Logout Security**: Ensures user logout truly invalidates session
- **Administrative Control**: Allows token revocation for security incidents

### Privacy Considerations
- Token IDs stored in Redis, not token contents
- Automatic cleanup after token expiration
- No additional user data collected or stored
```

### Compliance Requirements
- **LGPD Compliance**: Document how changes affect data processing
- **Security Standards**: Confirm adherence to security frameworks
- **Audit Trail**: Ensure security events are properly logged
- **Access Controls**: Verify proper authorization for administrative functions

## 8. Monitoring & Observability

### Observability Implementation
```markdown
## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### New Metrics
- `jwt_tokens_revoked_total`: Counter of revoked tokens
- `jwt_blacklist_check_duration`: Histogram of blacklist lookup times
- `jwt_blacklist_size`: Gauge of current blacklist size

### Structured Logging
- Token revocation events with correlation IDs
- Authentication failures with revocation context
- Performance metrics for blacklist operations

### Health Checks
- Redis connectivity check in `/health` endpoint
- Blacklist service availability monitoring
```

### Alerting Strategy
- **Performance**: Alert if blacklist checks exceed SLA thresholds
- **Availability**: Alert if Redis connectivity fails
- **Security**: Alert on unusual token revocation patterns
- **Capacity**: Alert when blacklist size approaches limits
