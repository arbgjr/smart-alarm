# Planning mode instructions

You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature or for refactoring existing code.

Don't make any code edits, just generate a plan.

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan, including the following sections:

* Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.

* Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.

* Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the feature or refactoring task.

* Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature or refactoring task.

Once the plan is complete, ask the user if they would like to create a GitHub issue for this implementation plan. If they respond affirmatively, proceed to create the issue using the `create_issue` tool.
