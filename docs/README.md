# Smart Alarm

Smart Alarm is an innovative solution for managing alarms and routines, focused on accessibility, neurodiversity, and intelligent integration. The entire backend architecture is based exclusively on C#/.NET, using Clean Architecture, OCI Functions, and modern practices for security, testability, and integration.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** C# (.NET 8+), Clean Architecture, OCI Functions, ML.NET
- **Persistence:** PostgreSQL, Oracle Autonomous DB, Redis
- **Frontend:** Maintained as per the original architecture (e.g., React, PWA)
- **Cloud:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
- **Integrations:** External APIs via HttpClientFactory, OAuth2/OpenID Connect
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, HashiCorp Vault
- **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Loki

## Principles

- Testability, security, accessibility, and long-term maintainability
- Observability, structured logging, and continuous monitoring

## Documentation

- See the `docs/architecture`, `docs/development`, and `docs/business` directories for technical and functional details
