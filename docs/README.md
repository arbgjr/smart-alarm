# Smart Alarm Documentation

Welcome to the Smart Alarm documentation. This project builds intelligent alarm systems with PWA capabilities, AI-powered sleep insights, and real-time multi-device synchronization, specifically designed for neurodivergent users.

## 🚀 Production-Ready System

Smart Alarm is now **production-ready** with comprehensive features:

- ✅ **Complete PWA Implementation** - Offline-first with service worker and background sync
- ✅ **AI-Powered Sleep Intelligence** - Privacy-first ML with personalized recommendations  
- ✅ **Real-time Multi-Device Sync** - SignalR with push notifications and conflict resolution
- ✅ **Production-Grade Testing** - 95%+ test coverage with comprehensive E2E testing
- ✅ **Enterprise Security** - JWT + FIDO2, encrypted storage, and WCAG AAA compliance
