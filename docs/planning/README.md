# Planning Directory - MOVED

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Directory Reorganization Notice

This directory has been reorganized to improve project structure. All planning documents have been moved to the centralized planning location.

## New Location

All implementation plans and planning documents are now located in:

**üìÅ [`/docs/plan/`](../plan/)**

### Available Documents:

- **[Implementation Plans Index](../plan/README.md)** - Complete overview of all plans
- **[MVP Roadmap Implementation Plan](../plan/feature-mvp-roadmap-implementation-1.md)** - Current active implementation plan
- **[Frontend Implementation Plan](../plan/feature-frontend-implementation-1.md)** - Detailed frontend development strategy
- **[Project Evolution Historical](../plan/project-evolution-historical-1.md)** - Historical context and evolution analysis

## What Was Moved

The following files were consolidated into the new structure:

- `projectEvolution.md` ‚Üí Archived in `project-evolution-historical-1.md`
- `projectPlanning.md` ‚Üí Content integrated into active implementation plans

## Benefits of Reorganization

‚úÖ **Single Source of Truth**: All plans in one location  
‚úÖ **Standardized Format**: Consistent template across all plans  
‚úÖ **Better Organization**: Clear priority and status tracking  
‚úÖ **Automated Processing**: Machine-readable format for AI agents  
‚úÖ **Improved Navigation**: Index with relationships and dependencies  

## How to Navigate

1. **For Current Work**: Start with [README.md](../plan/README.md)
2. **For Implementation**: Use [feature-mvp-roadmap-implementation-1.md](../plan/feature-mvp-roadmap-implementation-1.md)
3. **For Context**: Read [project-evolution-historical-1.md](../plan/project-evolution-historical-1.md)
