# Architecture Overview - Smart Alarm System

Welcome to the architecture documentation for the Smart Alarm system. This section provides comprehensive insights into our technical decisions, system design, and architectural patterns that make this inclusive application both powerful and accessible.

## üèóÔ∏è System Philosophy

Our architecture is built around a fundamental understanding that users have diverse relationships with technology, time management, and cognitive processing. Rather than forcing users to adapt to traditional alarm systems, we've designed a system that adapts to individual preferences and needs.

The architecture embodies three core principles that guide every technical decision we make:

**Reliability as a Foundation**: For users who depend on medication reminders or critical appointments, system failures aren't just inconvenient‚Äîthey can have serious consequences. Our architecture prioritizes redundancy, graceful degradation, and multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure that critical alarms always reach users.

**Accessibility as a Design Driver**: Rather than retrofitting accessibility features onto a traditional system, we've built accessibility considerations into the fundamental architecture. This means that features like offline functionality, multiple notification channels, and adaptive timing aren't add-ons‚Äîthey're integral parts of how the system operates.

**Privacy as a Competitive Advantage**: Users often share sensitive information about their schedules, medication times, and daily routines. Our architecture processes this sensitive data locally whenever possible, using advanced techniques like differential privacy for any analysis that requires aggregation across users.

## üéØ Architectural Patterns and Decisions

### Unified C# Service Architecture

Our system employs a unified C# backend architecture. All backend services (Alarm Service, AI/Analysis Service, Integration Service) are implemented exclusively in C#/.NET, following Clean Architecture and SOLID principles. Each service is a separate .NET project, preferably serverless (Azure Functions), with strong boundaries for testability, security, and maintainability.

The **C# Alarm Service** handles all high-frequency CRUD operations for alarms, leveraging .NET's async/await and optimized runtime for low-latency, high-throughput scenarios.

The **C# AI/Analysis Service** uses ML.NET for behavioral analysis and recommendations. When absolutely necessary, interoperability with Python is encapsulated via Python.NET, but all business logic and data handling remain in C#.

The **C# Integration Service** manages all external integrations (calendars, notifications, third-party APIs) using mature .NET libraries and robust error handling patterns (Polly, HttpClientFactory, etc).

This unified approach simplifies deployment, onboarding, and scaling, while ensuring consistent coding standards, error handling, and security across all backend services.

### Progressive Web Application (PWA) Architecture

The frontend implements a full PWA architecture that prioritizes offline functionality and cross-platform compatibility. This architectural choice addresses several critical needs for users who might have unreliable internet connections, use various devices, or need consistent experiences across different environments.

The PWA architecture ensures that core functionality remains available even when connectivity is poor or absent. Service Workers cache essential resources and data, allowing users to create, modify, and receive alarms without depending on network availability. This offline-first approach is particularly crucial for medication reminders, where network outages cannot be allowed to interfere with critical health management.

The application shell architecture loads instantly on repeat visits, reducing the waiting time for interfaces to become available. This responsiveness is especially important for users who might lose focus or abandon tasks if applications take too long to load.

### Data Architecture and Privacy Design

Our data architecture implements privacy-by-design principles through a combination of local processing, encryption, and selective data sharing. User data follows a strict hierarchy of sensitivity, with different types of information receiving different levels of protection and processing location.

**Local-Only Data** includes immediate user interactions, draft alarm configurations, and real-time interface state. This information never leaves the user's device and is processed entirely within the browser's secure context.

**Encrypted Personal Data** encompasses completed alarms, user preferences, and accessibility settings. This data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM before transmission and storage, with encryption keys derived from user credentials using robust key derivation functions.

**Anonymized Analytics Data** includes aggregated patterns that help improve AI recommendations across the user base. This data undergoes differential privacy processing to ensure that individual user patterns cannot be reconstructed from the aggregate data, even by the system operators.

The AI analysis architecture performs most behavioral pattern recognition locally using TensorFlow.js, ensuring that sensitive cognitive patterns and timing preferences remain on the user's device. Only anonymized, aggregated insights are shared with the broader system to improve recommendations for all users.

## üîß Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Technology Choices

React 18 with TypeScript provides the foundation for our frontend, chosen for its excellent accessibility ecosystem and mature tooling for complex state management. The React ecosystem includes numerous libraries specifically designed for accessibility, such as React Aria and Headless UI, which provide screen reader optimization and keyboard navigation out of the box.

TypeScript adds compile-time safety that helps prevent the runtime errors that could disrupt critical alarm functionality. For a system that users depend on for health management, preventing bugs before they reach production is essential for maintaining trust and reliability.

Tailwind CSS handles styling with a utility-first approach that makes it easier to implement consistent accessibility features like high contrast modes, reduced motion preferences, and scalable typography. The utility class system also makes it simpler to implement the numerous visual customization options that neurodivergent users often need.

### Backend Technology Rationale

All backend services are implemented in C# with .NET, providing a consistent, high-performance, and secure foundation. Modern .NET (6+) delivers excellent concurrency, async/await support, and minimal overhead in serverless environments (Azure Functions).

ML.NET is used for all AI and behavioral analysis needs. Integration with TensorFlow or PyTorch is possible via .NET libraries if required, but the core logic and data processing always remain in C#.

All external integrations (calendars, notifications, etc.) are handled via .NET libraries, with OAuth2/OpenID Connect for authentication and Polly for resilience.

This approach ensures:
- Single language for all backend code
- Easier onboarding and maintenance
- Unified security, logging, and monitoring
- Consistent testability and documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

### Database and Storage Architecture

Oracle Autonomous Database serves as our primary data store, chosen for its self-managing capabilities and strong security features. The autonomous database automatically handles patching, tuning, and scaling, reducing operational overhead while maintaining the high availability that critical alarm systems require.

The database architecture uses JSON document storage within Oracle's converged database platform, providing NoSQL flexibility for storing diverse user configurations while maintaining ACID transaction guarantees for critical alarm operations. This hybrid approach allows for schema evolution as we learn more about neurodivergent user needs while ensuring data consistency for critical functions.

Time-to-Live (TTL) functionality automatically expires old alarm data in compliance with LGPD requirements, while encryption at rest protects sensitive user information using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.

## üìä Scalability and Performance Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling Strategy

Each backend service in the C# architecture scales independently based on its specific load and resource requirements. .NET's efficient async/await and Azure Functions' serverless scaling ensure that alarm operations, AI analysis, and integrations can all scale horizontally as needed, without the complexity of managing multiple language runtimes.

### Performance Optimization Patterns

Circuit breaker patterns protect against cascading failures when external services become unavailable or slow. This is particularly important for an alarm system, where external service failures shouldn't prevent core alarm functionality from working.

Caching strategies reduce load on both our services and external APIs while improving response times for users. Cache invalidation is carefully managed to ensure that critical alarm changes are reflected immediately while less critical data can be cached longer for performance benefits.

Database connection pooling and query optimization ensure that database operations remain fast even under high load. The Go alarm service uses prepared statements and connection pooling to minimize database overhead for the high-frequency CRUD operations that form the core of user interactions.

## üîí Security Architecture Principles

### Defense in Depth Implementation

Our security architecture implements multiple layers of protection, recognizing that no single security measure is sufficient for protecting sensitive health and behavioral data. Network-level protections, application-level security, and data-level encryption work together to create comprehensive protection.

Network policies restrict communication between services to only the minimum necessary for functionality. Service mesh technology provides encrypted communication between internal services, while external communications are protected by TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning.

Application-level security includes authentication using FIDO2/WebAuthn for passwordless access, which is particularly beneficial for neurodivergent users who might struggle with traditional password management. Authorization is implemented using role-based access control with the principle of least privilege.

### Data Protection and Privacy Engineering

Data classification systems ensure that different types of user information receive appropriate protection levels. Personal identifiers are encrypted with different keys than behavioral pattern data, allowing for selective access and processing based on legitimate needs.

Cryptographic erasure enables true data deletion by destroying encryption keys rather than attempting to locate and delete all copies of encrypted data. This approach ensures compliance with right-to-deletion requirements while being more reliable than traditional data deletion methods.

Audit logging captures all access to sensitive data for compliance reporting and security monitoring, while differential privacy techniques protect individual user privacy even in aggregated analytics data.

## üåê Integration and Extensibility

### External Service Integration Patterns

The integration service implements standardized patterns for connecting with external calendar systems, notification providers, and accessibility services. These patterns include retry logic with exponential backoff, circuit breakers for handling service outages, and rate limiting to respect external service constraints.

OAuth 2.0 with PKCE provides secure authorization for external service integrations while maintaining user control over data sharing permissions. Users can selectively grant access to specific external services without compromising the security of their core alarm data.

Webhook systems enable real-time synchronization with external calendar systems while maintaining data consistency and handling conflicts when the same alarm is modified in multiple systems simultaneously.

### Plugin Architecture for Future Extensions

The modular service architecture provides natural extension points for adding new functionality without modifying core alarm services. Future plugins could add specialized analysis for specific neurodivergent conditions, integrations with healthcare providers, or advanced accessibility features.

API versioning ensures that external integrations and future plugins can evolve independently while maintaining backward compatibility with existing functionality. This is particularly important for accessibility features, where breaking changes could significantly impact users who depend on specific interface behaviors.
