## 📋 Document Mapping from Knowledge Base

Here's how the existing knowledge base documents will be organized:

### Architecture Documentation
- `Full Technical Stack` → `docs/architecture/system-overview.md`
- `ADR-001: Webapp Architecture` → `docs/architecture/adr-001-backend.md`

### Development Guides
- `Frontend Development Instructions` → `docs/development/frontend-development.md`
- `Backend API Instructions` → `docs/development/backend-development.md`
- `PWA & Notifications Instructions` → `docs/development/pwa-notifications.md`
- `Project Overview Instructions` → `docs/development/getting-started.md`

### Deployment and Operations
- `Deployment & Security Instructions` → `docs/deployment/production-deployment.md`
- Security sections → `docs/deployment/security-hardening.md`
- Monitoring sections → `docs/deployment/monitoring-observability.md`

### Planning and Roadmap
- `MVP Roadmap` → `docs/research/roadmap-planning.md`
- Market analysis sections → `docs/research/market-analysis.md`

## 🎯 Documentation Categories Explained

### Architecture Documentation
This section contains high-level system design decisions, architecture decision records (ADRs), and technical specifications. These documents help developers understand the "why" behind technical choices and provide guidance for future architectural decisions.

### Development Guides
Practical, hands-on documentation for developers working on the codebase. These guides include setup instructions, coding standards, testing procedures, and detailed implementation guidance for each service in your multi-language architecture. Think of these as your team's shared knowledge base that ensures consistency and quality across all development work.

### API Documentation
Comprehensive reference materials for all service APIs, including authentication patterns, endpoint specifications, error handling, and integration examples. This documentation serves both internal developers and potential third-party integrators who might want to build upon your platform.

### Accessibility Documentation
Specialized guidance focusing on neurodivergent user needs, WCAG compliance, and inclusive design principles. This section recognizes that accessibility isn't just about compliance—it's about creating genuinely usable experiences for people with different cognitive patterns and sensory processing needs.

### Security Documentation
In-depth coverage of security architecture, threat models, and compliance requirements. Given that your application handles sensitive health-related data for vulnerable populations, security documentation needs to be particularly thorough and regularly updated.

### AI Documentation
Technical specifications for machine learning models, privacy-preserving techniques, and behavioral analysis algorithms. This section helps developers understand how AI features work while ensuring transparency about data usage and model decision-making processes.

### User Guides
End-user documentation written in accessible language that helps neurodivergent users get the most out of your application. These guides should be written with cognitive accessibility in mind, using clear language and step-by-step instructions.

### Compliance Documentation
Legal and regulatory compliance materials, including privacy policies, data retention schedules, and accessibility statements. This documentation protects both users and the organization while demonstrating commitment to ethical data practices.

### Research Documentation
Background research, user studies, competitive analysis, and product planning materials. This section provides context for design decisions and helps team members understand the broader landscape in which your application operates.

## 📝 Documentation Standards and Guidelines

### Writing Standards
All documentation should follow these principles to ensure accessibility and clarity for neurodivergent contributors and users:

**Language Clarity**: Use simple, direct language whenever possible. Complex technical concepts should be broken down into digestible explanations with practical examples. Avoid jargon unless it's clearly defined, and provide context for acronyms and technical terms.

**Structure and Organization**: Each document should follow a consistent structure with clear headings, logical flow, and predictable organization. Use plenty of white space and avoid overwhelming walls of text that can be difficult for people with attention differences to process.

**Visual Accessibility**: Documentation should be readable in high contrast modes and should not rely solely on color to convey information. Include alt text for images and diagrams, and ensure that code examples are properly formatted for screen readers.

**Cognitive Load Management**: Break complex procedures into step-by-step instructions. Use numbered lists for sequential tasks and bullet points for related but non-sequential information. Provide clear indicators of progress through multi-step processes.

### Technical Documentation Requirements
Technical documents should include working code examples, clear error messages and troubleshooting steps, version compatibility information, and links to related documentation. Each technical guide should be testable—someone following the instructions should be able to complete the task successfully.

### Maintenance and Updates
Documentation should be treated as living code that requires regular maintenance. Each major feature addition or architectural change should include corresponding documentation updates. Regular reviews should ensure that documentation remains accurate and helpful as the codebase evolves.

## 🔄 Migration Plan for Existing Knowledge Base

The migration from your current knowledge base to this structured documentation system should happen incrementally to maintain development momentum while improving organization.

### Phase 1: Core Architecture and Development Setup
Begin by creating the fundamental architecture documentation and development setup guides. These documents will help new contributors understand the system quickly and provide a foundation for all other documentation.

Start with the Architecture Decision Record (ADR-001) as it provides crucial context for technical decisions. Follow with the system overview and getting started guide to establish the basic framework that other documents will reference.

### Phase 2: Service-Specific Documentation
Create detailed documentation for each service in your multi-language architecture. The Go alarm service, Python AI service, and Node.js integration service each have unique development requirements and architectural considerations that need thorough explanation.

Focus on practical implementation guidance that helps developers work effectively with each technology stack while understanding how the services interact with each other.

### Phase 3: Specialized Areas
Develop the accessibility, security, and AI documentation that covers your application's unique characteristics. These specialized areas require deep expertise and should be written with input from subject matter experts in each domain.

The accessibility documentation, in particular, should be developed in collaboration with neurodivergent community members to ensure that it reflects real user needs rather than just compliance requirements.

### Phase 4: User-Facing and Compliance Documentation
Complete the documentation suite with user guides and compliance materials. These documents often require legal review and should be developed in collaboration with stakeholders who understand regulatory requirements and user communication needs.

## 🎯 Success Metrics for Documentation

Effective documentation should measurably improve developer productivity, reduce support burden, and enhance user satisfaction. Track metrics such as time-to-first-contribution for new developers, frequency of documentation-related support requests, and user satisfaction scores for self-service support.

Regular feedback collection from both internal team members and external contributors will help identify gaps and improvement opportunities in your documentation strategy.

The ultimate goal is creating documentation that genuinely helps people accomplish their goals, whether they're developers trying to understand the codebase, users learning to use accessibility features, or stakeholders evaluating compliance with regulatory requirements.
