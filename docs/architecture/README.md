## ðŸŽ¯ Key Principles

Our architecture embodies three core principles:
- **Reliability as Foundation**: Critical alarms cannot fail
- **Accessibility as Design Driver**: Technical choices support neurodivergent users
- **Privacy as Competitive Advantage**: Local processing protects sensitive data
