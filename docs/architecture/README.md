# Architecture Documentation

This section documents the system architecture of Smart Alarm, explaining how technical decisions support neurodivergent user needs.

## ðŸ“‹ Contents

- **[Architecture Overview](architectureOverview.md)** - Comprehensive insights into our technical decisions, system design, and architectural patterns.
- **[System Overview](/docs/memory-bank/systemOverview.md)** - High-level architecture and service interactions
- **[ADR-002: Single-Language Backend](adr-002-single-language-backend.md)** - Architecture decision record
- **[Security Architecture](security-architecture.md)** - Privacy-by-design implementation
- **[Performance Considerations](performance-considerations.md)** - Scalability and optimization decisions

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Principles

Our architecture embodies three core principles:
- **Reliability as Foundation**: Critical alarms cannot fail
- **Accessibility as Design Driver**: Technical choices support neurodivergent users
- **Privacy as Competitive Advantage**: Local processing protects sensitive data
