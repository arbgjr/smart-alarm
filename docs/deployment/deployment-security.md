# Deployment & Security - Backend C#/.NET

This document describes the recommended deployment and security practices for the Smart Alarm backend, now fully based on C#/.NET and Azure Functions.

## üîí Security Principles

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - JWT/FIDO2 for authentication.
  - RBAC and claims for authorization.
  - Native integration with Azure AD and OAuth2/OpenID Connect.
- **Data Protection:**
  - Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (Azure Key Vault).
  - Environment segregation (dev, staging, prod) and secrets managed via Azure Key Vault.
- **Validation and Sanitization:**
  - Strict input/output validation (FluentValidation).
  - Data sanitization to prevent XSS, SQL Injection, and other attacks.
- **Observability and Auditing:**
  - Structured logging (Serilog), distributed tracing (Application Insights), alerts, and auditing of critical events.
- **Error Policy:**
  - Centralized exception handling, user-friendly responses, and no leakage of sensitive details.

## üöÄ Automated Deployment

- **CI/CD:**
  - Automated pipelines (GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps) for build, tests, static analysis, and deployment.
  - Serverless deployment via Azure Functions, with slots for blue/green deployment.
  - Infrastructure as code (Bicep/Terraform) for secure and reproducible provisioning.
- **Testing:**
  - Automated tests (unit, integration, security) required in the pipeline.
  - Minimum 80% coverage for critical code.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Application Insights for metrics, logs, and alerts.
  - Custom dashboards for health and security monitoring.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist

- [x] JWT/FIDO2 authentication implemented
- [x] Secrets and keys protected in Azure Key Vault
- [x] Logging and tracing enabled
- [x] Data validation and sanitization on all endpoints
- [x] CI/CD with static analysis and automated tests
- [x] Serverless deployment (Azure Functions) with slots
- [x] Monitoring and alerts active

## Final Notes

- The entire backend is C#/.NET, with no dependencies on Go, Python, or Node.js.
- Security and deployment practices follow Microsoft and OWASP recommendations.
- Periodic security and compliance reviews are mandatory.
