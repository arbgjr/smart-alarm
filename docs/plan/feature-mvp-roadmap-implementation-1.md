# Smart Alarm MVP Roadmap Implementation Plan

## Introduction

This implementation plan addresses the critical gaps identified in the Smart Alarm MVP Roadmap analysis (July 2025). The backend is 100% production-ready with comprehensive infrastructure, but critical user experience gaps prevent the system from being fully functional for end users.

This plan focuses on resolving the 4 identified critical gaps through systematic implementation phases, transitioning the project from a backend-complete state to a fully functional MVP with excellent user experience.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

### Critical Gap Requirements

- **REQ-001**: Complete RoutineController implementation with full REST API endpoints
- **REQ-002**: React 18 + TypeScript frontend application with JWT authentication integration
- **REQ-003**: Comprehensive E2E testing coverage for all user workflows
- **REQ-004**: Real-time notification system with WebSocket/SignalR implementation

### Security Requirements

- **SEC-001**: JWT token validation and refresh in frontend application
- **SEC-002**: Secure API communication with CORS configuration
- **SEC-003**: Input validation on all frontend forms matching backend FluentValidation
- **SEC-004**: XSS and CSRF protection implementation

### Technical Constraints

- **CON-001**: Must integrate with existing .NET 8 microservices architecture

## 3. Alternatives

### Frontend Technology Alternatives Considered

- **ALT-001**: Next.js instead of Vite + React - Rejected due to unnecessary complexity for SPA requirements and preference for lighter build tools
- **ALT-002**: Vue.js instead of React - Rejected to maintain consistency with team expertise and React ecosystem maturity
- **ALT-003**: Angular instead of React - Rejected due to heavier framework overhead and different paradigm from existing backend patterns
- **ALT-004**: Svelte instead of React - Rejected due to smaller ecosystem and less mature accessibility tooling

### State Management Alternatives

- **ALT-005**: Redux Toolkit instead of React Query + Context - Rejected as React Query provides better server state management and Context is sufficient for client state
- **ALT-006**: Zustand instead of Context API - Considered for complex state but Context + useReducer is adequate for current scope
- **ALT-007**: Jotai for atomic state management - Rejected as unnecessary complexity for current requirements

### Testing Framework Alternatives

- **ALT-008**: Cypress instead of Playwright - Rejected due to Playwright's superior performance and native mobile testing capabilities
- **ALT-009**: Jest + jsdom instead of Vitest - Rejected due to Vitest's better TypeScript support and faster execution
