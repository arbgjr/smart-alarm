# [TASK023] - MVP Phase 3: Core User Interface Implementation

**Status:** In Progress - 45% Complete  
**Added:** 2025-07-30  
**Updated:** 2025-07-30 (Documentação Completa Criada)

## Original Request

Implement Phase 3 of the Smart Alarm MVP Roadmap - Core User Interface phase, building upon the completed frontend foundation to create comprehensive user interfaces for alarm and routine management with full CRUD functionality.

## Thought Process

With Phase 2 (Frontend Foundation) at 75% completion, we now have:

✅ **Established Foundation**:

- Dashboard component with real-time stats
- AlarmService and RoutineService with full API integration  
- useAlarms and useRoutines hooks with React Query
- AlarmList and RoutineList components
- Error handling and loading states
- Authentication system fully operational

**Phase 3 Focus**: Expand from basic display to full user interface functionality

1. **Form Implementation**: Create/Edit forms for alarms and routines
2. **Dedicated Pages**: Full pages for alarm and routine management
3. **Navigation Enhancement**: Routing between different sections
4. **User Experience**: Complete CRUD workflows with proper feedback
5. **Interface Polish**: Responsive design and accessibility

The backend APIs are production-ready with all CRUD endpoints, so we can implement full functionality immediately.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 3: Core User Interface (Weeks 5-8)

- Duration: 4 weeks  
- Scope: Complete user interface for alarm and routine management
- Dependencies: Phase 2 Foundation (✅ Complete), Backend APIs (✅ Ready)
