# [TASK022] - MVP Phase 2: Frontend Foundation

**Status:** Complete - 100% Complete  
**Added:** 2025-07-30  
**Updated:** 2025-01-07

## Original Request

Implement Phase 2 of the Smart Alarm MVP Roadmap - Frontend Foundation phase, building upon the completed authentication system to create the core dashboard interface and connect with real backend APIs. This phase establishes the foundation for all user-facing functionality.

## Thought Process

With the authentication system fully operational (completed 30/07/2025) and RoutineController 75% complete, we now have the foundation needed to implement the main dashboard interface. This phase focuses on:

1. **Dashboard Implementation**: Create the main user interface for alarm and routine management
2. **Real API Integration**: Connect frontend to actual backend APIs (replacing mock services)  
3. **Core Navigation**: Establish the main navigation structure for the application
4. **Data Management**: Set up React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
5. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for API operations

The authentication system provides:

- ✅ JWT token management with automatic refresh
- ✅ Protected route system
- ✅ User state management with React Query
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for all auth operations

The backend provides:

- ✅ AlarmController with full CRUD operations
- ✅ RoutineController with 7 REST endpoints  
- ✅ JWT authentication on all endpoints
- ✅ Production-ready infrastructure

This phase will create the bridge between authenticated users and functional alarm/routine management.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 2: Frontend Foundation (Weeks 3-4)

- Duration: 2 weeks  
- Scope: Dashboard interface and real API integration
- Dependencies: Authentication system (✅ Complete), Backend APIs (✅ Ready)
