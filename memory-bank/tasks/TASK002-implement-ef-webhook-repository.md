# TASK002 - Implement EF Webhook Repository

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-07-19  
**Updated:** 2025-07-19  

## Original Request
Replace the current InMemoryWebhookRepository with a proper Entity Framework Core implementation to provide persistent storage for webhook data.

## Thought Process
The WebhookController was successfully implemented during the technical debt resolution, but it currently uses InMemoryWebhookRepository for data persistence. While the controller logic is complete and functional, production requires a proper database-backed repository implementation.

This is a lower-priority task since webhook functionality is not critical to the core alarm features, but it should be completed for a complete production system.

Technical considerations:
- Need to create Webhook entity in Domain layer
- Implement EfWebhookRepository in Infrastructure layer
- Add webhook-related DbSet to SmartAlarmDbContext
- Create database migration for webhook table
- Update dependency injection to use EF repository instead of in-memory
- Maintain existing controller interface and behavior

## Implementation Plan
1. Create Webhook domain entity and value objects
2. Define IWebhookRepository interface in Domain
3. Implement EfWebhookRepository with Entity Framework Core
4. Add Webhook DbSet to database context
5. Create and apply database migration
6. Update dependency injection configuration
7. Test CRUD operations through WebhookController

## Progress Log

- Task created as part of final production preparation
- WebhookController is already implemented and functional
- Current InMemoryWebhookRepository works but needs persistence
- This is the only remaining infrastructure gap for production completeness
