# [TASK021] - MVP Roadmap Implementation Phase 1

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-07-19  
**Updated:** 2025-07-19

## Original Request

Implement Phase 1 of the Smart Alarm MVP Roadmap - API Completion phase, focusing on creating the missing RoutineController with full CRUD operations to resolve the highest priority gap (Priority: 10.00) identified in the systematic gap analysis.

## Thought Process

The MVP roadmap analysis identified that while the Smart Alarm backend is 100% production-ready, there are 4 critical gaps preventing complete user access:

1. **RoutineController API** (Priority: 10.00) - HIGHEST
2. **Frontend Application** (Priority: 3.13)
3. **E2E Integration Tests** (Priority: 3.00)
4. **Real-time Notifications** (Priority: 2.67)

Phase 1 focuses exclusively on the RoutineController implementation because:

- Domain logic already exists and is fully implemented
- Only the REST API controller layer is missing
- This is a prerequisite for frontend routine management UI
- Has highest impact/effort ratio (10.00 priority score)

This approach follows the established Clean Architecture patterns and will integrate seamlessly with existing microservices structure.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: API Completion (Weeks 1-2)

- Duration: 2 weeks  
- Scope: Complete missing REST API endpoints for Routine Management
- Dependencies: None - domain logic is complete

### Subtask Breakdown

| ID | Description | Estimated Hours | Files Affected |
|----|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1.1 | Implement RoutineController with full CRUD operations | 8-10 | `/src/SmartAlarm.Api/Controllers/RoutineController.cs` |
| 1.2 | Add GetRoutinesByUser endpoint with pagination | 3-4 | Controller + Application layer queries |
| 1.3 | Implement ActivateRoutine and DeactivateRoutine endpoints | 4-5 | Controller + Domain logic integration |
| 1.4 | Add BulkUpdateRoutines endpoint for batch operations | 5-6 | Controller + batch processing logic |
| 1.5 | Update Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all new endpoints | 2-3 | OpenAPI documentation updates |
| 1.6 | Add integration tests for RoutineController endpoints | 6-8 | Test infrastructure setup |
| 1.7 | Validate RoutineController with existing domain logic | 3-4 | Integration validation testing |
| 1.8 | Performance testing for routine operations under load | 4-6 | Load testing setup and execution |

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 75%
