# [TASK005] - WSL Development Environment Setup

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-31  
**Updated:** 2025-07-31

## Original Request

Configure Smart Alarm to run in WSL and be accessible from Windows browser for cross-platform development.

## Thought Process

The user needed a way to develop the React frontend in WSL while accessing it from Windows browser. This required:

1. Configuring Vite for external network access
2. Creating automation scripts for WSL environment
3. Comprehensive documentation and verification system
4. Seamless cross-platform development workflow

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Configure Vite server for external access (host: '0.0.0.0')
- [x] Create WSL development startup script with IP detection
- [x] Write comprehensive WSL setup guide with troubleshooting
- [x] Create environment verification script
- [x] Update project README with WSL quick start
- [x] Test complete workflow and verify all components

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

     host: '0.0.0.0', // Allow external access from Windows
     port: 5173,
     strictPort: true
   }
   ```

2. **start-wsl-dev.sh** - Automated development script with:
   - WSL environment detection
   - IP address discovery and display
   - Dependency verification
   - Colored terminal output
   - Error handling and guidance
