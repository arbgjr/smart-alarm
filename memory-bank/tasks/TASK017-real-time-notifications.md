# [TASK017] - Real-time Notifications

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** July 19, 2025  
**Updated:** July 19, 2025

## Original Request
Implement WebSocket/SignalR for real-time alarm notifications to replace the current polling-based approach. This addresses the medium-priority gap (Priority: 2.67) where users must poll for alarm status instead of receiving live updates.

## Thought Process
This emerged as a medium priority feature because:
- **High User Impact (4/5)**: Significantly improves user experience with instant notifications
- **High Strategic Alignment (4/5)**: Important for modern real-time user experience
- **Medium Implementation Effort (3/5)**: SignalR integration with existing architecture
- **Medium Risk Level (2/5)**: Well-understood technology, some complexity with authentication
- **Priority Score: 2.67** - Fourth highest in prioritization matrix

The integration service already has notification commands, but there's no real-time delivery mechanism. Users currently need to poll for updates.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. SignalR Hub Implementation (1-2 days)
- Create `NotificationHub` for real-time communication
- Implement user authentication and connection management
- Add proper connection grouping by user/tenant
- Handle connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect)

### 2. Backend Integration (2-3 days)  
- Integrate SignalR with existing notification commands
- Update alarm trigger workflows to send real-time notifications
- Add routine execution status updates
- Implement notification queuing for offline users

### 3. Frontend Integration (2-3 days)
- Add SignalR JavaScript client to React frontend
- Implement notification components and toast system
- Handle connection state management and reconnection
- Add notification preferences and settings

### 4. Push Notification Support (2-3 days)
- Implement browser push notification subscription
- Add push notification service integration
- Handle notification permissions and fallbacks
- Support offline notification delivery

### 5. Testing & Quality (1-2 days)
- Unit tests for SignalR hub and connection management
- Integration tests for end-to-end notification flow
- Load testing for concurrent connections
- Frontend notification testing

## Notification Types
- **Alarm Triggered**: Real-time notification when alarm goes off
- **Routine Started/Completed**: Status updates for routine execution  
- **System Alerts**: Important system notifications or errors
- **Reminder Notifications**: Configurable reminder alerts
- **Integration Updates**: Calendar sync, external service status

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users receive real-time notifications when alarms are triggered
- [ ] Routine execution status updates delivered instantly
- [ ] SignalR connections authenticated with JWT tokens
- [ ] Connection state management handles reconnection gracefully
- [ ] Browser push notifications work for offline users
- [ ] Notification preferences configurable per user
- [ ] Multiple device support (notifications to all user devices)
- [ ] Notification history and read/unread status tracking
- [ ] Load testing validates performance with 1000+ concurrent connections
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Dependencies
- ✅ Authentication system (JWT) working
- ✅ Notification commands in integration service
- ⚠️ **Required**: Frontend Application (TASK015) for client implementation
- ✅ Redis infrastructure available for backplane scaling

## Estimated Effort
**Total: 8-11 days (1.5-2 weeks)**
- SignalR Hub: 1-2 days
- Backend Integration: 2-3 days
- Frontend Integration: 2-3 days  
- Push Notifications: 2-3 days
- Testing & Quality: 1-2 days

## Technical Considerations
- **Security**: Validate JWT tokens for SignalR connections
- **Scalability**: Redis backplane for multi-instance SignalR
- **Reliability**: Connection retry logic and offline notification queuing
- **Performance**: Optimize for high concurrent connection counts
- **Privacy**: User-scoped notifications, no cross-user data leakage

## Success Metrics
- **Real-time Delivery**: <1 second latency for critical notifications
- **Connection Reliability**: >99% uptime for active connections
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ concurrent connections
- **User Adoption**: >80% of users enable real-time notifications
- **Performance**: No impact on existing API response times
