# [TASK015] - Frontend Application Epic

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** July 19, 2025  
**Updated:** July 19, 2025

## Original Request
Create a complete modern, accessible React-based frontend application to provide a user-facing interface for the Smart Alarm system. This addresses the critical gap (Priority: 3.13) where the system has a fully functional backend but no user interface, making it unusable for non-technical end users.

## Thought Process
This emerged as the #2 priority feature because:
- **Critical User Impact (5/5)**: System is completely unusable without a frontend
- **High Strategic Alignment (5/5)**: Essential for any user-facing product
- **High Implementation Effort (4/5)**: Significant development work required
- **Medium Risk Level (2/5)**: Well-understood technology stack
- **Priority Score: 3.13** - Second highest in prioritization matrix

This is marked as an Epic because it encompasses multiple sub-features and will take significant development time. The existing tasks 003-013 will be consolidated under this epic.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Week 1)
- Set up React 18+ with TypeScript and Vite
- Configure Tailwind CSS with Headless UI for accessibility
- Set up development environment and tooling
- Implement basic routing and layout structure

### Phase 2: Authentication & Core Infrastructure (Week 2)
- Implement JWT-based authentication with token refresh
- Set up state management (Zustand + React Query)
- Create API client with proper error handling
- Implement basic loading states and error boundaries

### Phase 3: Core User Interfaces (Weeks 3-4)
- Dashboard with alarm overview and quick actions
- Alarm management interface (CRUD operations)
- Routine management interface (drag-drop functionality)
- User settings and preferences

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 5)
- Real-time notifications via SignalR integration
- PWA capabilities (service worker, offline support)
- Push notification subscription management
- Calendar integration views

### Phase 5: Quality & Polish (Weeks 6-7)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance optimization and Core Web Vitals
- Comprehensive testing (unit + E2E with Playwright)
- Mobile responsiveness and PWA installation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register, login, and manage their profile
- [ ] Complete alarm management (create, edit, delete, schedule)
- [ ] Complete routine management with drag-drop interface
- [ ] Real-time notifications when alarms are triggered
- [ ] PWA installable on mobile and desktop platforms
- [ ] Offline functionality for viewing existing data
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance throughout
- [ ] Responsive design works on all screen sizes (mobile-first)
- [ ] All forms have proper validation and error handling
- [ ] Loading states and error boundaries implemented
- [ ] E2E tests cover all critical user journeys
- [ ] Core Web Vitals meet performance benchmarks

## Dependencies
- ✅ Backend API fully implemented and functional
- ✅ Authentication system (JWT) working
- ⚠️ **Missing**: Routine Management API (TASK014 - highest priority)
- ⚠️ **Missing**: Real-time notification endpoints (TASK017)
- ✅ All core domain functionality available via existing APIs

## Estimated Effort
**Total: 35 days (7 weeks for 1 developer)**
- Can be parallelized with multiple developers
- Estimated for experienced React/TypeScript developer
- Includes comprehensive testing and accessibility compliance

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Well-established technology stack
- **Known Challenges**: Real-time integration, PWA complexity, accessibility compliance
- **Mitigation**: Start with MVP, iterate with user feedback, thorough testing
