# [TASK016] - E2E Integration Tests

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** July 19, 2025  
**Updated:** July 19, 2025

## Original Request
Implement comprehensive end-to-end integration test suite covering full user scenarios to ensure the complete system works correctly across all components and integrations. This addresses the quality assurance gap (Priority: 3.00) identified in the gap analysis.

## Thought Process
This emerged as the #3 priority feature because:
- **Medium User Impact (2/5)**: Indirectly benefits users through system reliability
- **Medium Strategic Alignment (3/5)**: Important for quality but not core business feature
- **Low Implementation Effort (2/5)**: Well-understood patterns, existing test infrastructure
- **Low Risk Level (1/5)**: Standard testing practices, known tooling
- **Priority Score: 3.00** - Third highest in prioritization matrix

While unit tests exist, the system lacks comprehensive end-to-end testing to validate complete user workflows from API to database, which is critical for production deployment confidence.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Test Infrastructure Setup (2-3 days)
- Configure TestContainers for isolated PostgreSQL database testing
- Set up WireMock.NET for external service mocking
- Implement test data factories and cleanup procedures
- Create base test classes with shared infrastructure

### 2. Authentication & Authorization Test Suite (1-2 days)
- Test complete registration and login flows
- Validate JWT token lifecycle (creation, refresh, revocation)
- Test role-based authorization across all endpoints
- Verify FIDO2 authentication integration

### 3. Core Business Logic Tests (3-4 days)
- **Alarm Lifecycle**: Create → List → Update → Schedule → Trigger → Delete
- **Routine Lifecycle**: Create → Associate with alarms → Execute → Monitor → Delete  
- **User Management**: Registration → Profile updates → Settings → Account deletion
- **Holiday Integration**: Configure holidays → Validate alarm skipping

### 4. External Integration Tests (2-3 days)
- Calendar integration flows with mocked Google/Outlook APIs
- Notification delivery with mocked email/SMS providers
- Webhook delivery and retry logic testing
- File upload/download with MinIO storage testing

### 5. Performance & Load Testing (1-2 days)
- Authentication endpoint performance benchmarks
- Critical API endpoint load testing with NBomber
- Database query performance validation
- Memory and resource utilization testing

### 6. CI/CD Integration (1 day)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated test execution
- Parallel test execution configuration
- Test results reporting and coverage metrics
- Deployment blocking on test failures

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 16.1 | Setup TestContainers infrastructure with PostgreSQL | Not Started | - | Isolated database per test |
| 16.2 | Configure WireMock.NET for external service mocking | Not Started | - | Mock Google, Outlook, notification APIs |
| 16.3 | Implement authentication and authorization test suite | Not Started | - | Complete JWT lifecycle testing |
| 16.4 | Create alarm lifecycle end-to-end tests | Not Started | - | Full CRUD + scheduling + triggering |
| 16.5 | Create routine lifecycle end-to-end tests | Not Started | - | Full workflow testing |
| 16.6 | Implement external integration test suite | Not Started | - | Calendar, notifications, webhooks |

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: xUnit with TestContainers for database isolation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL container for each test run
- **Authentication**: Test JWT tokens for different user roles (Admin, User)
- **External Services**: WireMock.NET for mocking Google Calendar, Outlook, notification providers
- **Performance**: NBomber for load testing critical endpoints
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions integration with parallel test execution
- **Coverage**: Target 80%+ coverage of critical user paths

## Test Categories

### 1. Authentication Flows
```csharp
[Fact] 
public async Task CompleteAuthenticationFlow_RegisterLoginRefreshLogout_Success()
// Test: Register → Login → Access protected endpoint → Refresh token → Logout
```

### 2. Business Logic Flows  
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task AlarmLifecycle_CreateUpdateScheduleTriggerDelete_Success()
// Test: Create alarm → Update properties → Schedule → Trigger via Hangfire → Delete
```

### 3. Integration Flows
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task CalendarSync_GoogleCalendarIntegration_EventsImportedSuccessfully()
// Test: Configure Google auth → Import calendar events → Create alarms → Verify sync
```

### 4. Performance Benchmarks
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task AuthenticationEndpoint_RespondsUnder200ms()
// Test: Authentication endpoint performance under load
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All critical user journeys have comprehensive E2E test coverage
- [ ] Tests run in completely isolated containers with clean state
- [ ] Authentication and authorization flows fully validated
- [ ] External integrations tested with realistic mocks
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and monitored
- [ ] Tests complete in under 10 minutes on CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test coverage reports generated automatically
- [ ] Failed tests block deployments to higher environments
- [ ] Test data cleanup ensures no side effects between tests
- [ ] Parallel test execution working without conflicts

## Environment Requirements
- **Local**: Docker for TestContainers, .NET 8 SDK
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Docker support
- **Test Data**: Factories for creating realistic test scenarios
- **Cleanup**: Automatic test data and container cleanup

## Dependencies
- ✅ Backend API fully implemented and functional
- ✅ Authentication system working with JWT + FIDO2
- ✅ Database migrations and seed data working
- ✅ External integration infrastructure (mocking capabilities)
- ⚠️ **Preferred**: Routine Management API (TASK014) for complete coverage

## Estimated Effort
**Total: 9-12 days (2-2.5 weeks)**
- Test Infrastructure: 2-3 days
- Core Business Logic Tests: 4-5 days  
- Integration & Performance Tests: 2-3 days
- CI/CD Integration: 1 day
- Documentation & Polish: 1 day

## Success Metrics
- **Coverage**: ≥80% of critical user paths tested end-to-end
- **Performance**: All tests complete in <10 minutes
- **Reliability**: Tests pass consistently without flaky failures
- **Maintainability**: Tests are easy to understand and update
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated execution on every PR and merge

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Well-established testing patterns and tooling
