# TASK001 - Deploy to Production OCI

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-07-19  
**Updated:** 2025-07-19  

## Original Request
Deploy the Smart Alarm system to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Functions for production environment after technical debt resolution.

## Thought Process
With all critical technical debt resolved on 2025-07-19, the system is now ready for production deployment. The architecture is designed for serverless deployment on OCI Functions, with all real service implementations active for production environments.

Key considerations:
- All three microservices (AI, Alarm, Integration) need to be deployed
- Oracle Autonomous Database needs to be configured as the production database
- OCI Object Storage, OCI Vault, and OCI Streaming need to be properly configured
- Environment-specific configuration needs to be validated
- Health checks and monitoring need to be verified in production

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up OCI Functions environment and dependencies
2. Configure Oracle Autonomous Database
3. Deploy microservices to OCI Functions
4. Configure production secrets and environment variables
5. Validate health checks and monitoring
6. Execute production smoke tests

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Not Started - 0%
