  "connectionString": "Data Source={vault:database-host};User Id={vault:database-user};Password={vault:database-password};SSL Mode=Require;",
  "pooling": true,
  "maxPoolSize": 20,
  "connectionTimeout": 30
}
```

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-001**: Given a production deployment, When all services are running, Then health check endpoints return 200 OK within 2 seconds
- **AC-002**: Given a database connection, When the application starts, Then it successfully connects to Oracle Autonomous Database using SSL
- **AC-003**: Given file upload functionality, When a user uploads a file, Then it is stored in OCI Object Storage and accessible via CDN
- **AC-004**: Given secrets management, When the application needs configuration, Then all secrets are retrieved from OCI Vault without exposure in logs
- **AC-005**: Given API rate limiting, When requests exceed defined limits, Then API Gateway returns 429 Too Many Requests
- **AC-006**: Given monitoring setup, When system metrics exceed thresholds, Then alerts are sent to configured notification channels
- **AC-007**: Given backup procedures, When scheduled backup runs, Then database backup is created and stored with appropriate retention

## 7. Rationale & Context

The Smart Alarm platform requires a serverless architecture to provide cost-effective scaling and high availability. OCI Functions was chosen for its integration with other Oracle services and competitive pricing model. The multi-provider pattern allows for development flexibility while ensuring production readiness.

The security requirements reflect the need to comply with LGPD regulations and protect user data. The performance criteria ensure the system can handle expected load while maintaining responsive user experience.

The choice of Oracle Autonomous Database for production provides automatic scaling, patching, and backup capabilities, reducing operational overhead while ensuring enterprise-grade reliability.

## 9. Examples & Edge Cases

### Function Configuration Example
```yaml
# OCI Functions deployment configuration
functions:
  - name: smart-alarm-api
    image: iad.ocir.io/smartalarm/api:latest
    memory: 512MB
    timeout: 60s
    environment:
      ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Production
      DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING: ${vault:database-connection}
      REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING: ${vault:redis-connection}
      
  - name: smart-alarm-webhook
    image: iad.ocir.io/smartalarm/webhook:latest
    memory: 256MB
    timeout: 30s
    environment:
      WEBHOOK_SECRET: ${vault:webhook-secret}
```

### Edge Cases
- **Cold Start**: Functions must handle cold starts gracefully with appropriate timeouts
- **Database Connection Loss**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Storage Service Unavailable**: Fallback to local temporary storage with async sync
- **High Traffic Spikes**: Auto-scaling must handle sudden load increases
- **Certificate Expiration**: Automated renewal process with monitoring alerts

### Disaster Recovery Scenario
```bash
# Backup restoration procedure
terraform plan -var="restore_from_backup=true" -var="backup_id=OCID123"
terraform apply
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
```
